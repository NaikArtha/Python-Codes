# A recent survey has been made on the people reading various
# newspapers. Based on the survey, some group of people reading „The Hindu‟ and/or
# „Indian Express‟ have been considered. Assume cluster A is reading „The Hindu‟
# and
# cluster B is reading „Indian Express‟.
# Use a suitable sequence data type to compute the following task such as:
#  People reading both the newspapers
#  People reading either of newspapers
#  People reading only „The Hindu‟, but not „Indian Express‟
#  People reading only „Indian Express‟, but not „The Hindu‟
# Sample Input:
# Cluster A: {Aarthi, Lavanya, Rekha, Praveen, Sankar, Sai, Nirmal, Vignesh}
# Cluster B :{ Lavanya, Praveen, Priyanka, Janani, Nirmal, Karthik, Kishore, Gopi}
# sample output:
# (i) People reading both the newspapers are
#  Lavanya
#  Praveen
#  Nirmal
